# Echo Skool Waitlist - Developer Context Document

## Key Features Implemented

- Located right after hero section for immediate impact

### 2. Hormozi Value Framework Applied

- **Problem-Agitate-Solve**: "Sound Familiar?" section with pain points

### 3. Custom Components

- Logarithmic scale for community size (50-500,000 members)
- Real-time calculations showing time saved and revenue increase
- Currently positioned after monetization section

## Current Page Structure

1. **Navigation** - Simple with theme toggle
2. **Hero Section** - Main value prop with Aurora background
3. **Pilot Program Urgency** - 3 spots visual tracker
4. **Value Stack** - Hormozi-style value breakdown
5. **Pricing Comparison Table** - Pilot vs Future pricing
6. **Sound Familiar?** - Pain points section
7. **What We'll Build Together** - Features with SpotlightCards
8. **Monetization Opportunities** - Revenue carousel
9. **ROI Calculator** - Interactive impact calculator
10. **Pilot Program Details** - What you get vs what we need
11. **Risk Reversal** - Triple guarantee section
12. **FAQ** - Accordion-style questions
13. **Three-Tier Final CTA** - Pilot, Waitlist, Competition options
14. **Footer** - Standard footer with links

## Color Scheme
All colors use Tailwind's Skool brand palette:
- **skool-red**: #E85449 (primary CTA color)
- **skool-yellow**: #F5B800 (value/highlight color - replaced green)
- **skool-cyan**: #4FC3F7 (accent color)
- **skool-salmon**: #FF8A80 (secondary accent)

**Note**: No emojis used throughout per client requirement

## Known Issues & TODOs

### Potential Improvements
1. **ROI Calculator Simplification**: Currently has 4 sliders, could be reduced to 2 (members & price)
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Check all sections on mobile devices
3. **Performance**: Aurora animations might need optimization for mobile
4. **Form Integration**: No actual form submission yet - needs backend integration
5. **Analytics**: No tracking/analytics implemented yet

### Spacing Observations
- All sections use `py-20` (80px vertical padding) consistently
- Some sections might benefit from reduced padding on mobile
- Consider adding section anchors for smooth scrolling

## Deployment Instructions

### For Netlify Deployment:
```bash
# Build production version
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (requires Netlify CLI)
netlify deploy --prod

# Or use drag-and-drop with the 'out' folder
```

### Environment Variables Needed:
None currently required, but may need:
- Email service API keys for form submission
- Analytics tracking IDs
- Supabase credentials if integrating with backend
