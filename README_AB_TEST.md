## 🎨 Version A: "Soft Sell"

**Psychological Strategy:** Trust-building through transparency

**Flow:**
1. Hero with clear problem/solution
2. "EXAMPLE SCENARIO" with honest labeling
3. Clean pricing ($1,997)
4. Risk reversal (2 guarantees)
5. Simple FAQ
6. Single CTA

**Target:** Analytical, research-driven buyers who need proof and transparency.

**Expected:** Higher trust, better qualified leads, slower conversions.

## 🔥 Version B: "Hard Sell"

**Psychological Strategy:** Fear-based urgency and scarcity

**Flow:**
1. Aggressive problem headline
2. 4 pain points + cost calculator (-$24k/year)
3. 3-benefit solution grid
4. Urgent pricing with strike-through
5. Urgency-framed FAQ
6. "LAST CHANCE" CTA

**Target:** Pain-aware, impulse buyers who respond to urgency and FOMO.

## 📈 Testing Strategy

### Metrics to Track:
1. **Primary:** Quiz completion rate (visitor → quiz completed)
2. **Secondary:** Bounce rate, time on page, scroll depth
3. **Business:** Lead quality, pilot conversion rate

### Success Criteria:
- **Winner:** >15% improvement in quiz completions
- **Sample Size:** 500+ visitors per variant
- **Duration:** 2-3 weeks

### My Prediction:
- **Version B** will get more quiz starts
- **Version A** will get more qualified leads
- **Version A** will have better close rate

**Net result:** Depends on your priority (volume vs quality).
